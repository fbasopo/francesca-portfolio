                I am originally from Zimbabwe, where I completed my IGCSEs and A-Levels. I studied at Rhodes University, earning a Bachelor of Science with Distinction, double majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems, and later completed a BSc Honours in Information Systems. During my studies, I gained experience coding in C++, MIPS, SQL, PHP, F#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

                I now have nearly four years of professional experience as a Full Stack Engineer, building resilient backend systems in C#/.NET and polished, user-friendly frontend apps in React. I’ve also led application support for core systems, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver efficient and scalable solutions.
