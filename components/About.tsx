                I am originally from Zimbabwe, where I completed my IGCSEs and A-Levels.
                I studied at Rhodes University, earning a Bachelor of Science with Distinction, double majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems, and later completed a BSc Honours in Information Systems.

                During my studies, I gained experience coding in C++, MIPS, SQL, PHP, F#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I now have nearly four years of professional experience as a Full Stack Engineer, building resilient backend systems in C#/.NET and polished, user-friendly frontend apps in React.
